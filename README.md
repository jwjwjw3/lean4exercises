# Lean 4 Exercises

Solutions to exercises in E-Book: **Mathematics in Lean v0.1** (Textbook: https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/, GitHub: https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean). Some of my solutions are longer than reference solutions, some others are shorter. In some Chapters I also added some more interesting examples together with formally verified proofs besides those in the E-Book. Chapters 1-4 are formally verified using Lean 4.12.0, and Chapter 5-9 are formally verified using Lean 4.15.0. 

Chapter 01-09 are uploaded. There is no estimation on when I'll upload Chapter 10-12 since my focus has shifted from learning Lean 4 to using Lean 4 to prove some nontrivial theorems in Deep Learning Theory.
