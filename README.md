# Lean 4 Exercises

My own solutions to exercises in E-Book: **Mathematics in Lean v0.1** (Textbook: https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/, GitHub: https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean). Some of my solutions are longer than reference solutions, some others are shorter. All my solutions are verified using Lean 4.12.0.
